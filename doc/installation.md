Configuration
-------------

### Locations

Configuration is by default looked for in the following directories, loaded in this order:

 - ```RbConfig::CONFIG['sysconfdir']/hammer/``` (The actual value depends on your operatingsystem and ruby defaults.)
 - ```/etc/hammer/```
 - ```~/.hammer/```
 - ```./config/``` (config dir in CWD)
 - custom location (file or directory) specified on command line - ```-c CONF_FILE_PATH```

In each of these directories hammer is trying to load ```cli_config.yml``` and anything in
the ```cli.modules.d``` subdirectory which is place for specific configuration of hammer modules a.k.a. plugins.

Later directories and files have precedence if they redefine the same option. Files from ```cli.modules.d```
are loaded in alphabetical order. The modules are loaded in alphabetical order which can be overriden with explicit requirement of dependences in the modules.

### Manual installation
The packaged version of hammer copies the template to `/etc/hammer` for you.
When you install from gems or source you'll have to copy config files manually.

The configuration templates are contained in the hammer_cli gem

 ```bash
gem contents hammer_cli|grep template.yml
```
and can be copied to one of the locations above and changed as needed.


### Tuning options

Hammer uses [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) formatting for its configuration.

List of existing options is available in the [configuration template file](https://github.com/theforeman/hammer-cli/blob/master/config/cli_config.template.yml)
with descriptions.


### Plugins

Plugins are disabled by default. To enable plugin create configuration file in ```cli.modules.d``` and add```:enable_module: true``` in it.
Plugin specific configuration must be nested under plugin's name (without the ```hammer_cli_``` prefix).

In the example we assume the gem ```hammer_cli_foreman``` with the Foreman plugin is installed. Then the plugin configuration
in ```~/.hammer/cli.modules.d/foreman.yml``` should look as follows:

```yaml
:foreman:
    :enable_module: true
    :host: 'https://localhost/'
    :username: 'admin'
    :password: 'changeme'
```

Autocompletion
--------------

It is necessary to copy the hammer_cli_complete script to the bash_completion.d directory.

    $ sudo cp hammer-cli/hammer_cli_complete /etc/bash_completion.d/

Then after starting a new shell the completion should work.
